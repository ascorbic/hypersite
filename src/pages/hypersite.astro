    <h1>HyperSite!</h1>

    <p>
      This site is built in the style of a 1990 <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a
      > stack. HyperCard was a pre-web hypermedia app that came with early Macs.
      You could build stacks, which were a little like local-only websites, with
      cards that were like pages that could be linked together and elements that
      could be scripted using a procedural event-based language called HyperTalk.
      It was where I first learned to code "useful" things (in 1991 or so) as opposed
      to messing about with BASIC or Logo, and meant that the web felt very familiar
      when I first encountered it a few years later.

      Fonts, icons and graphics are all based on the 1980s originals, mostly by
      the iconic <a href="https://kareprints.com/">Susan Kare</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got the idea for this site from the <a href="https://wes.dev/">Wes95</a>
      site by Wes Souza.

    <p>
      Design inspiration (and the cursor icon) from
      <a href="https://hcsimulator.com/">HyperCard Simulator</a>.

      The recreated "Chicago" font is <a
        href="https://fontsarena.com/sysfont-by-alina-sava/">Sysfont</a
      > by Alina Sava.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recreated "Geneva" font is <a
        href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1304775/geneva-9"
        >Geneva 9.1</a
      > by Kelsey Higham.

      This icons and graphics are all originals from HyperCard by Susan Kare,
      extracted in the <a href="https://egardepe.itch.io/hypercardgraphics"
        >HyperCard Graphics</a
      > pack.

      <a href="https://system6.app">Infinite Mac</a> lets you run old versions of
      Mac OS in your browser. It was useful to remind me how System 6 and HyperCard
      worked in practice. I also found a couple of icons there.

      The toasters were (appropriately) manually extracted and cropped frame by
      frame from a GIF found in <a
