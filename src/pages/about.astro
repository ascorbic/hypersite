      <h2>Long bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a product-minded software engineer, with over 25 years of
        experience building for the web. I started out as a pastry chef, but
        moved into coding in my teens. Most of my early career was as a founder,
        but in recent years I have been building dev tool products at
        high-growth startups. I am currently employed as a core maintainer at <a
          href="https://astro.build">the Astro Technology Company</a
        >. Previously I was a principal engineer at Netlify, working on the
        frameworks team. Before that I worked at Gatsby, on the framework team.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love the open web and open source software, and have contributed to a
        large number of open source projects over the years, including most
        modern web frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I build a lot of photography and image tools, even though I'm not much
        of a photographer myself. My very first startup was creating tools for
        panoramic photography. I co-founded a company building <a
          href="https://petapixel.com/2013/09/19/triggertrap-releases-revamped-version-2-0-now-offers-14-triggering-options/"
          >app-based camera triggers</a
        >. I then created <a href="/projects/vela-one"
          >the world's fastest camera flash</a
        >. In more recent years, I worked on creating Gatsby's image plugin, and
        most recently I created
        <a href="/projects/unpic">Unpic</a>, a multi-framework component library
        and toolkit for displaying images on the web with around 30k weekly
        downloads.
      </p>
      <p>
        I live in the south-west of England with my wife and two children. I
        like baking and fermenting things, and making and drinking beer and
        cocktails.
