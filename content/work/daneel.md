Inspired by creating [Mixie](/projects/mixie) and
[Font Institute](/projects/font-institute), I wanted to create a tool that would
allow anyone to create their own OpenAI-powered chat bot. In 2023 when I created it there weren't many options for this kind of thing. I created Daneel, a template that allows you to create a chat bot that can be deployed to Netlify with a single click.

The frontend uses [Impala](/projects/impala), and the backend is a Netlify Edge
Function.
