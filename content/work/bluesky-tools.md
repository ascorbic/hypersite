I moved most of my social media activity to Bluesky, and have been enjoying the
open APIs that it provides. I've built a number of open source tools to work
with Bluesky content:

- [@ascorbic/bluesky-comments-tag](https://github.com/ascorbic/bluesky-comments-tag) -
  A lightweight, customizable web component to use Bluesky for your website
  comments.
- [@ascorbic/bluesky-loader](/projects/astro-loaders) - Use Bluesky post data in
  your Astro site.
- [@astro-community/astro-embed-bluesky](https://github.com/delucis/astro-embed/tree/main/packages/astro-embed-bluesky) -
  Embed Bluesky posts in your Astro site.
