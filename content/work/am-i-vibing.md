This library allows CLI tools and Node apps to detect when they're being executed by AI agents. This enables them to adapt by, for example, providing different output formats or logs, or disabling interactive prompts. It can detect various AI editors and agentic coding environments, such as Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and others.
